# Django-Ads-app
This website is a classified ad website. People can view ads without logging in and if they log in, they can create their own ads. It uses a social login that allows logging in using Github accounts. In this app, I used the MySQL database instead of SQLite which is the default in Django. I used my own classes which are inherited from the Django generic views classes.
